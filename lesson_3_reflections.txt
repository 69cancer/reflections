When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- We might have to use remote repository if our local machine is not available with us,
  at the time when we require to make some commits. Differences in github repository and
  local will be similar if we either push the changes from any another system or directly 
  from the github site. Sometimes another person working on our project might push the 
  commits to github repository.
