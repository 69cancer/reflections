What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- It initializes a git repository. We can either initialize in a new directory 
  thats doesnt have been initialized with git, in these case git does not carry
  any commits when we create repository  or with the one that has been already 
  initialized with git, in these case it wonâ€™t affect the history of the commits.
  We need to do it to let the git track the history of our files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is a file can be called as holding area, generally contained in 
  the Git directory, that stores information about what will go into the next commit.
  Staging area allows to control what parts of the working tree go into the 
  repository on the next "commit" operation.
  staging helps to split up one large change into multiple commits. Suppose We worked on a
  large change, involving a lot of files and quite a few different subtasks.Now the change
  is all tested and working, we need to commit all this properly, in several clean commits 
  each focused on one aspect of the code changes.
